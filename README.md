A tutorial is available for this program at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WPCLda_erI

## Description

"This program uses Inquirer to take user input via the command line. Then it processes and formats the information via javascript, and outputs a markdown file with the formatted information."



- The Problem I hope to solve: The hassle of rewriting a readme file for each and every project.

- The way I hope to solve it: By handling the formatting for you, so you only need input the relevant info.

- Solving this problem was difficult for the following reasons: Learning Inquirer was difficult, but I'm glad to have overcome it.

- I learned the following: How to user Inquirer, as well as better professional formatting.
